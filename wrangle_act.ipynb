    "- The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv \n",
    "- Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (i.e. \"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data we will find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, we will query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then we will read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count.\n"
